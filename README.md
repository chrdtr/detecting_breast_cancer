# Detecting breast cancer:

A dataset has been provided for analysis, containing different features which all have been measured during breast
cancer scans. The features have been computed from digitised images of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a breast mass.

The main goal is to make predictions whether or not potential features could lead to a diagnosis of breast cancer. To 
achieve this, it was decided to train and test different machine learning models on the data provided. After validation,
the model delivering the best predictions should be chosen. 

As the output variable is binary, we are facing a classification problem:
  
  y = M or 1 = malignant
  y = B or 0 = benign

To make and compare predictions, the following machine learning models have been selected:

  1. Binary logistic regression (BLR)
  2. Support vector machines (SVM)
  3. Decision trees (DT)
  4. Random forests (RF)











The data was provided by London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), as part of its Data Analytics Career Accelerator program.
